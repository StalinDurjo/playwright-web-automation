## WooCommerce tax-related scenarios:

1. **Tax Calculation Accuracy:**

   - Test for different tax classes, such as standard tax rates, reduced rates, and zero rates.
   - Test with multiple products in the cart, each with different tax classes.

   - Test with different rounding precision settings (e.g., nearest whole number, nearest 0.05).

5. **Tax Rate Changes:**

   - Test that tax calculations update correctly when tax rates are changed.
   - Test for immediate recalculation of taxes when tax rates are modified.
   - Test for scenarios where tax rates are changed mid-checkout.

===================================================

## Product file upload functionality:

1. **File Type Validation**:

   - Test uploading files of different types (e.g., .pdf, .jpg, .png, .docx) to ensure that only allowed file types are accepted.
   - Test uploading a file with an invalid file type to ensure that it is rejected with an appropriate error message.

2. **File Size Limit**:

   - Test uploading files of various sizes, including files larger than the allowed limit, to ensure that files exceeding the size limit are rejected with an appropriate error message.
   - Test uploading files smaller than the allowed limit to ensure that they are accepted without any issues.

3. **Multiple File Upload**:

   - Test uploading multiple files simultaneously to ensure that all files are successfully uploaded and associated with the product.
   - Test uploading multiple files when some files exceed the size limit to ensure that the upload process handles each file appropriately.

4. **File Upload Visibility**:

   - Test uploading files for both simple and variable products to ensure that the file upload option is displayed and functional for all product types.
   - Test uploading files for products with variations to ensure that files are correctly associated with each product variation.

5. **File Upload Fields**:

   - Test adding multiple file upload fields to a product to ensure that each field functions independently, allowing users to upload different files for different purposes (e.g., one for product images, another for product documentation).
   - Test adding a required file upload field to a product to ensure that users cannot proceed without uploading the required file.

6. **File Upload Persistence**:

   - Test saving a product draft with uploaded files to ensure that the files are retained when the product is saved as a draft and later edited.
   - Test deleting a product with uploaded files to ensure that the associated files are also deleted and not retained unnecessarily.

7. **Downloadable Product Handling**:

   - Test uploading files for downloadable products to ensure that the files are securely stored and only accessible to users who have purchased the product.

8. **Performance Testing**:

   - Test uploading a large number of files simultaneously to ensure that the system can handle concurrent file uploads without performance degradation.
   - Test uploading files under different network conditions (e.g., slow internet connection) to ensure that the upload process remains responsive and reliable.

9. **Integration Testing**:

   - Test integrating with third-party services or plugins that extend WooCommerce's file upload functionality (e.g., cloud storage integration) to ensure seamless compatibility and data integrity.
   - Test importing products with associated files from external sources to ensure that the file upload functionality behaves as expected during data migration processes.

10. **Security Testing**:
    - Test uploading files with malicious content (e.g., viruses, malware) to ensure that the system properly detects and prevents the upload of such files.
    - Test uploading files with special characters and unconventional file names to ensure that the system handles them securely without compromising file integrity or system stability.
